# LUNA - Lightweight graphical engine

LUNA is a program, written in C, that is able to render 3D models. The goal of this project is to "reinvent the wheel". Luna is not about providing an analog for other 3D-rendering engines or 3D editing programs. Luna is about exploring the mind-blowing world of math, geometry and programming, discovering all the magic that is befalling while your computer is translating the simple binary numbers to 3D-objects which can be seen on your screen.

The only library that has been used for developing LUNA is Simple DirectMedia Layer - SDL. In a nutshell, the library just basically allows to draw pixels on the screen easily.
