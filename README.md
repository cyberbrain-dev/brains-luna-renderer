# LUNA - Lightweight graphical engine

### LUNA renderer is now no longer in development. Nevertheless, the code base and ideas of this project will become an awesome base for something bigger. Yours, Cyberbrain <3

LUNA is a lightweight 3D-rendering engine. Luna is not about providing an analog for other 3D-rendering engines or 3D editing programs. Luna is about exploring the mind-blowing world of math, geometry and programming, discovering all the magic that is befalling while your computer is translating the simple binary numbers to 3D-objects which can be seen on your screen.

The only library that has been used for developing LUNA is Simple DirectMedia Layer - SDL. In a nutshell, the library just basically allows to draw pixels on the screen easily.
